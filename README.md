# Computer Vision Project  

## Overview  
I created this project to explore and understand the world of computer vision.  

## Main Code (`main.py`)  
- `main.py` contains all the Python code for this project.  
- It imports OpenCV to handle computer vision tasks.  

## Arduino Integration  
- The main Python script also integrates Arduino code.  
- This allows communication between the Arduino board and the Python program.
